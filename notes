sync request in microservices mean a direct request from one service to another

AUTH STRATEGIES
1: from ORder Service send sync request to Auth service to check if auth

1.1: send request first to an auth gateway to check if is auth, and if is, pass the request on

k create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=jwt=asdf
k get secrets
k get services -n <namespace>
k get namespaces (all this time we were creating pods under the same namespace; if we are in client, accessing by http://auth-srv only works if they are in the same namespace)

k port-forward <pod_name> 4222:4222 (from local : port on the pod) ((needs to be kept running))

if you want to use common modules but have different languages for services (java, node, php), you can use JSON schema, Protobuf, Apache Avro with cross language support
